            cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including
            servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and
            intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster
            innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale
            <br />
            <br />
            The Cloud Shared Responsibility Model defines the responsibilities
            of both the cloud service provider and the customer regarding
            securing and managing cloud environments. In this model, the cloud
            service provider is responsible for the security of the cloud
            infrastructure, including the physical data centers, networking, and
            server hardware
            <br />
            <br />
            On the other hand, the customer is responsible for securing their
            applications, data, and operating systems that run on the cloud
            infrastructure. This includes configuring access controls,
            implementing encryption, and ensuring compliance with regulations.
            Depending on the cloud service model, whether
            Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), or
            Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), the exact division of responsibilities
            may vary but the overall concept remains the same
            <br />
            <br />
            We have very well experienced talents in the cloud computing to
            understand the customer needs and their chanllenges with their
            current infrastructure and hence we provide services to customers
            24/7.
